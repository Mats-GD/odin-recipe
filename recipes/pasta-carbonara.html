        Carbonara is a pasta dish made with fatty cured pork, hard cheese, eggs, salt, and black pepper. It is typical
        of the Lazio region of Italy. The dish took its modern form and name in the middle of the 20th century.

        The cheese used is usually pecorino romano. Some variations use Parmesan, Grana Padano, or a combination of
        cheeses. Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but bucatini or rigatoni are also used. While guanciale, a cured
        pork jowl, is traditional, some variations use pancetta, and lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute
        outside Italy.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
        <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)/li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)</li>
        <li>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add
            the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.

            Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic
            into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon
            and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.

            Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta
            that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.

            Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle
            when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)</li>
        <li>Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta
            water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.</li>
    </ol>

        A poké bowl is the modern, Western variation of the Hawaiian dish *poke*. The dish consists of a bowl filled
        with various finely sliced ingredients that are arranged separately in an elegant manner and served lukewarm or
        cold, topped with a sauce. The original Hawaiian dish consists (among other things) of finely sliced raw fish.
        This Hawaiian dish has Japanese origins. The modern version emerged around 2012 and has been gaining popularity
        ever since.
